# Amazon-Sales-Analysis
During my one-month internship, I was assigned a project to analyze an Amazon sales dataset. The objective was to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights to support data-driven decisions.

Task:
I was responsible for performing end-to-end sales analysis, including data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and visualization, using MS Excel. My goal was to identify actionable insights from the dataset and present findings clearly and effectively.



Data Cleaning:
Removed 100+ duplicate entries.
Corrected inconsistent data types for key columns such as dates and numerical fields.
Addressed blank cells by imputing appropriate values based on the data context.
Data Preparation:

Created additional columns for Month and Year to enable trend and pattern analysis.
Standardized formatting to ensure consistency across 10,000+ rows of data.
Analysis & Visualization:

Built pivot tables and charts to analyze sales trends, fulfillment methods, and regional distribution.
Visualized findings using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to highlight key insights.

Result:
Identified that T-shirts and shirts accounted for 35% of total sales, making them the top-selling products.
Found that 70% of orders were fulfilled directly by Amazon, with the remaining 30% fulfilled by merchants.
Discovered that sales peaked in April and May, contributing to 25% of total annual revenue.
Highlighted that 99% of sales were non-B2B transactions, indicating a primarily consumer-driven market.
Pinpointed Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu as top-performing regions, accounting for 40% of sales collectively.
By cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data, I provided actionable insights to understand product performance, seasonal trends, and geographic distribution effectively.
